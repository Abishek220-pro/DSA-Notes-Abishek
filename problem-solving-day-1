# Day 1 - Arrays (Fundamentals) ✅ COMPLETED

**Date:** [Today]
**Time Spent:** [X hours]
**Week:** 1/7 (Arrays Week)
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETED

## Learning Phase (2 hours)
✅ Learned 8 Core Array Concepts:
  1. What is an Index? (starts at 0)
  2. Accessing Elements - O(1)
  3. Updating Elements - O(1)
  4. Array Size vs Capacity
  5. Basic Operations (Access, Update, Insert, Delete)
  6. Traversal - O(n)
  7. Memory Layout (Contiguous)
  8. Edge Cases (Empty, Single, Out of bounds)

2. ✅ COMPLETED - Two Sum (LEETCODE #1)
   Algorithm: Brute force nested loops
   Complexity: O(n²) time, O(1) space
   Status: SOLVED ✅
   
3. ✅ COMPLETED - Find Sum of All Elements (CUSTOM)
   Algorithm: Accumulation through traversal

   Status: SOLVED ✅
   
4. ✅ COMPLETED - Valid Palindrome / Reverse Array (CUSTOM/LEETCODE)
   Algorithm: Two pointer from both ends
   Complexity: O(n) time, O(1) space
   Status: SOLVED ✅
   
5. ✅ COMPLETED - Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock (LEETCODE #121)
   Algorithm: Tracking minimum price and maximum profit
   Complexity: O(n) time, O(1) space
   Status: SOLVED ✅

## Key Learnings from Today's 5 Problems
- ✅ Index starts at 0, not 1
- ✅ Array access is O(1) due to contiguous memory
- ✅ Traversal is O(n) - must visit each element
- ✅ Two Sum uses nested loops - O(n²) brute force
- ✅ Can optimize by tracking minimum/maximum
- ✅ Palindrome check using two pointers: O(n) time, O(1) space
- ✅ Profit problem: track min price, calculate profit at each step
- ✅ Single pass solution often optimal for tracking problems

## Concepts Mastered Today ✅
- ✅ Array fundamentals and indexing (0-based)
- ✅ Direct access and modification
- ✅ Traversal pattern (single pass)
- ✅ Two pointer technique (checking from both ends)
- ✅ Tracking min/max values
- ✅ Accumulation pattern (sum)
- ✅ Greedy/Optimal approach (profit tracking)

## Problems Completed This Week
- Day 1: 5/5 ✅ COMPLETED (Find Max, Two Sum, Sum, Palindrome, Buy/Sell)
- Day 2: 0/5 (Traversal, Search, Insert, Delete)
- Day 3: 0/5 (Rotation, Advanced Reversal)
- Day 4: 0/5 (Two Pointer Techniques)
- Day 5: 0/5 (Merging & Complex)
- Day 6: 0/5 (Hard Problems)
- Day 7: 0/5 (Mixed Review)

**Total: 5/35 problems completed ✅**

## What Went Well Today ✅
- ✅ Mastered basic traversal operations
- ✅ Understood Two Sum brute force approach
- ✅ Solved palindrome efficiently with two pointers
- ✅ Applied tracking pattern to stock problem
- ✅ Recognized O(1) access pattern clearly
- ✅ Two pointer technique working from both ends
- ✅ Problem solving efficiency improved

## Concepts to Remember
- **Max/Min:** Keep track of one variable, update as you traverse
- **Sum:** Initialize to 0, accumulate as you go
- **Palindrome:** Use two pointers from both ends, check equality
- **Profit Tracking:** Find minimum before current, calculate profit
- **Two Sum:** Can brute force with O(n²) or optimize with hash map later

## Tomorrow's Focus (Day 2)
- **Topic:** Traversal Deep Dive, Search, Insert, Delete
- **Solve:** 5 new problems
- **Goal:** Understand why Insert/Delete are O(n) (element shifting)
- **New Concepts:** 
  - Difference between element access and element insertion
  - Why shifting is expensive
  - Linear search vs index access
